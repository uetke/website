          <p class="lead">The aim of the course is to show that anybody can build software for the lab. Our intensive 3-day course covers from the basics of communicating with a device to building user interfaces.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="">Developing control software for labs with Python is becoming ubiquitous in all major research institutes around the world. Learn from real-world cases, with real devices and measurements. The courses are aimed at small groups of up tp 7 people in
            order to deliver personalized content to every attendant.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="">Do you want to have a course according to the specific needs of your lab? We can work something out together, drop us a line: courses@uetke.com</p>
