          <p class="text-justify">Developing control software for labs with Python is becoming ubiquitous in all major research institutes around the world. Learn from real-world cases, with real devices and measurements. The courses are aimed at small groups of 5 people in order
            to deliver personalized content to every attendant.&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="text-justify">The courses are aimed at participants who are comfortable analyzing data with Python or Matlab. If you already know how to open and read files, how to iterate over an array and write an if-statement, then you are ready to join. The course
                is hands-on from the first moment; you will receive a real device on the first day and by the end of the third day you will have an amazing user interface for interacting with it. While the course progresses you can keep the device to
                practice at home or in the office.</p>
              <h6 class="">Important: You should bring your own laptop to the course.</h6>
