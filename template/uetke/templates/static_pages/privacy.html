                <p>www.uetke.com Privacy Policy</p>
                <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their

                    information
                    security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact,
                    or
                    locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy

                <p>California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                    post a
                    privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
                    the
                    United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
                    Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                    exactly
                    the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. –

                <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br>
                    Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>
                    Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on
                    the first
                    significant page after entering our website.<br>
                    Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified
                    above.</p>
                <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
                <ul>
                    <li> On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?<br>
                    We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not
                    Track (DNT)
                    browser mechanism is in place.</p>
                <p>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<br>
                    It’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
                <p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
                <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old,
                    the
                    Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
                    Commission,
                    United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators
                    of
                    websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>
                <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.<br>
                    Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>
                <p>Fair Information Practices</p>
                <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
                    the
                    concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
                    around the
                    globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
                    critical
                    to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
                <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                    should a
                    data breach occur:<br>
                    We will notify you via email<br>
                    • Within 7 business days</p>
                <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                    legally
                    pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
                    principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                    that
                    individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                    non-compliance by
                    data processors.</p>
                <p>CAN SPAM Act</p>
                <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
                    commercial
                    messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
                    tough
                    penalties for violations.</p>
                <p>We collect your email address in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
                    <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original
                        transaction has
                        occurred.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
                    <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
                    <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
                    <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
                    <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
                    <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
                <ul>
                    <li> Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.</li>
                </ul>
                and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
