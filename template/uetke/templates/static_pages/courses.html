                is hands-on from the first moment; you will receive a real device on the first day and by the end of the third day you will have an amazing user interface for interacting with it. While the course progresses you can keep the device to
                practice at home or in the office.</p>

                    <p>We have developed three different courses to cover different needs. <a href="/courses/pythonlab/">Python For The Lab</a> is the basic course for people who already know some programming and want to go one step forward in controlling their setups. <a href="/courses/advanced/">Advanced Python for the Lab</a> is aimed at all those who already control their experiments and want to improve specific skills, such as working with high frame rate cameras, special DAQ cards, etc. <a href="/courses/gitscience/">Git for Scientists</a> covers all the steps to start building successful open science projects: from documenting projects to releasing to the public.</p>
