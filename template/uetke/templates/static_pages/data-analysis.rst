Data Analysis
=============


Our three main tasks:

Handling
^^^^^^^^
We help you develop policies and tools to store data in secure and redundant locations, establishing procedures for ensuring traceability and reproducibility of the results.

Analysis
^^^^^^^^
We find the best way to extract as much information from your data as possible. We can develop new tools or implement existing platforms. From statistical tests to image analysis.

Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Show your data in professional formats. High-quality plots and images to convey as much information as possible. From 3D figures to animations, ready to use in presentations, papers and applications.

Data Analysis for your Proposals
********************************
If you are writing a grant proposal and need help with the data analysis section, we can assist you. Don't let good experimental work be limited by the capabilities of your data analysis.

We can help you plan ahead and develop a detailed proposal including how data is going to be handled, schedules and costs included.

Contact us if you are unsure of how you are going to handle your data in your next proposal.

Agile Software Development
**************************
At Uetke we are committed to deliver solutions through an Agile process. We believe in that the best way to success is following the four values of the manifesto:
   * Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
   * Working Software over comprehensive documentation
   * Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
   * Responding to Change over following a plan


How do we work
**************
After building a setup, many researchers face the problem of analyzing large amounts of data without the proper tools. Sometimes it is not only about the quantity, but the complexity of the information gathered. Determining the edges of a cell, counting the number of nanoparticles in an image, fitting complex models, finding nearest neighbors, are just some examples of what a researcher may face.

At Uetke we work closely with scientists to understand what their needs are. We can help them understand what are the best statistical tests for their data and how to make the best out of what they have already acquired. Researchers can keep focused on their experiments while we make the best to understand their results. Analysing data is very time consuming especially when lacking the basic programming knowledge.

What do we deliver
******************
Depending on the task, we deliver different solutions. If we are asked to perform data analysis, we will deliver a completely open-source package that can be audited and expanded later on. We can also train researchers on how to analyse their data and how to better use computational resources. If we are asked to develop a data-handling procedure, we will deliver a custom made handbook with all the information. We will always work closely with researches to develop a full platform to meet their needs.



Why outsourcing data analysis
*****************************
Data analysis is a crucial part of any scientist's work. In order to reproduce results, researchers need not only data but also the analysis software that was used. Proprietary software doesn't allow users to audit its content and therefore bugs and updates can make it impossible to reproduce a result even starting from the same dataset. The world is asking for more open science and at Uetke we are prepared for it.

Researchers can't know everything about everything but they can leverage about the expertise of others. People focused into performing complex experiments sometimes lack the time to train themselves in data analysis and software development. Uetke can fill that gap with a sustainable approach. We deliver high quality software that can be inspected by its users. Our programs can, therefore, be used as learning examples for further development and can be audited by anyone.
