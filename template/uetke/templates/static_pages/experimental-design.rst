Experimental Design
===================


Uetke is committed to delivering integral solutions, that is why we don't consider only the costs involved and the development time. We also take into account, for example, who is going to conduct those experiments. A biologist shouldn't be asked to build microscopes and a physicist shouldn't be asked to prepare a cell culture.

If you have doubts weather the microscope you are about to buy will answer your questions, or you need help calculating frame rates, resolution and data handling procedures, contact us. We are here to help.
